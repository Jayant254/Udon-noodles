1. In a mixing bowl, add flour, salt, and add 1 1/4 cups water.

2. Mix with your hands until the dough starts to come together.

3. Press and knead the dough, and if necessary, add a little more water (1 tablespoon at a time).

4. Dust your work surface with some flour. Fold and firmly press the dough for 5-6 minutes.

5. When you notice the dough starts to feel fairly smooth, start shaping it into a ball.

6. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 2-4 hours.

7. Knead the dough for a few minutes and divide it into 4 balls.

8. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Use flour if the dough is starting to stick to the pin. If the dough is too sticky to be rolled out, cover it for another 10 minutes and try again.

9. Fold the dough into thirds and slice it width-wise into long noodles that are around 1/8".

10. Boil some water and add the noodles once the water starts boiling.

11. Stir frequently and adding some water if the water is bubbling over. Cook for around 10-15 minutes.

12. Drain the noodles and put them in icy water (this will make them less sticky). Rub with your hands to remove some of the starch.

13.  Heat your pan and add some oil.

14.  Pour the chopped vegetables in the pan.

15. Stir-fry for around 5 minutes before adding the sauce.

16. Stir-fry for another 3 minutes until the mix is well combined.

17.  Serve while itâ€™s still hot.
